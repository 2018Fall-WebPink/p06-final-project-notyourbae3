       <h3> <b> Oprah Gail Winfrey</b></h3>
        <p> Oprah Gail Winfrey was born to Vernita Lee and Vernon Winfrey on an isolated farm in Kosciusko, Mississippi, on January 29, 1954. </p>
        <br/> 
        <p> Even as a child, Winfrey was extremely smart. Under the guidance of her grandmother, she learned to read at two years old. Then Winfrey skipped kindergarten, saying she belonged in the first grade. She was promoted to third grade after that year.</p>
     <br/>
        <p> Oprah became an excellent student, participating in several clubs. She won a full scholarship to <a href="http://www.tnstate.edu/"> Tennessee State University </a> . The following year she went to a White House Conference on Youth. Soon after she was hired by the station to read afternoon newscasts. She knew then that she wanted to be "paid to talk."</p>
        <br/>
        <p> Winfrey moved to Chicago, Illinois, in 1984 and took over as anchor on A.M. Chicago. She changed the emphasis of the show from traditional women's issues to current and controversial topics. In September 1985 the program was renamed the Oprah Winfrey Show, and was expanded to one hour.</p>
        <br/>
        <p> Winfrey proved that anything is possible. She struggled for awhile before moving to Tennessee but still proved that she could make her dreams happen no matter her race, past, or struggles.</p>
